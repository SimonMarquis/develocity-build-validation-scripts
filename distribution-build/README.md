## Gradle Enterprise Build Validation Scripts

### Overview

The purpose of the _Build Validation Scripts_ is to assist you in validating that your build is in an optimal state in terms of maximizing work avoidance. The validation scripts do not actually modify your build, but they surface what can be improved in your build to avoid unnecessary work in several scenarios.

Details and instructions on how to use the build validation scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-enterprise-build-config-samples/blob/master/build-validation-scripts/README.md).
