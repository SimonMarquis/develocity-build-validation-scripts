# Experiments Automation

Scripts that automate many of the Gradle Enterprise trial experiments. Using
these scripts will help you to avoid many of the common mistakes people make as
they work through the various experiments. For example, the Experiment 1 script
ensures that the `--no-build-cache` flag is passed on every build invokation.
